You can find a rudimentary API at [http://iec.code4sa.org](http://iec.code4sa.org). You can find example api calls on the home page. In addition, Results and ResultSummaries can be filtered by geographical location e.g.

    http://iec.code4sa.org/results/?voting_district=10590006
    http://iec.code4sa.org/results/?ward=21001001
    http://iec.code4sa.org/results/?municipality=1
    http://iec.code4sa.org/results/?province=Gauteng
